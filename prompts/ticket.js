        #- Hello I was just wondering what does 2/5 risk and all those fraction risk mean
Does it mean like 40% chance of losing it all if it’s if it’s 2/5
The risk number indicates the potential for negative market movement after the tickets go on sale, so a 0/5 is us saying, there is little to no chance of these tickets going below face value
someone please give me some basic guidance on how to use proxies for resale? just bought a batch and I'm unsure how to get going with them.
you wanna do is download BP proxy switcher chrome extension. then just copy past my list of IPs? i have 25. 
is it recommended that I use a new chrome profile for every VF registration? or is switching the proxy enough.
it’s always good to sign up with different ips. 
does using a different IP just mean selecting a different proxy through bp proxy switcher? or making a new chrome profile as well?
Just by selecting different ip.
U2 tickets are transferable as long as you didn’t buy GA
if you use Lysted
They can transfer tickets for you with their transferless delivery BUT they offer no guarantees that it will work
I would honestly just sell them through ticketmaster resale fan to fan
if they cancel the sale anyway, they will make you pay the fees.
may I know which resell sites I should choose ? Viagogo or Lysted?🥹 
I want to sell U2 tickets?
Lysted! Viagogo is for international events
can i sign up for taylor swift tickets if im not from US and therefore dont have a US phone number?
a US or Canadian phone number is essential, as you mentioned. You can rent phone numbers online or use services like those in our partnership section.

        content: `Ticket delivery method that allows for entry into an event via a ticket barcode or QR code delivered to a mobile device.Seller is expected to verify inventory via Sync or though providing barcodes (if available). All tickets must be consecutive. Seat secure offers different categories of ticket listings: Pre-barcoded tickets for Ticketmaster events that are available for Instant Delivery. Tickets 
        are sent within minutes of order confirmation. As the name implies, these are tickets that the seller has in hand. These tickets are available 
        for immediate delivery (ships within 3 business days). Tickets that the seller has a 100% chance of delivering prior to the event, but 
        may not be in their possession at the time of listing. Sellers must be able to provide documentation of their 
        rights to such tickets if requested by Ticketmaster Resale; a specific delivery date must be noted in the listing. Third party events (3PE) are events for which Ticketmaster is not the primary ticket provider. 3PE provides sellers 
        expanded resale opportunities and additional options to fans shopping on our marketplace for tickets to non Ticketmaster events. 
        To ensure seamless and secure fan experiences, below are a few important guidelines on how to correctly list 
        tickets and fulfill orders for 3PE events.
        • As a reminder, we do not allow speculative ticket listings on Ticketmaster marketplaces. 
        • Currently, we do not sell 3PE tickets before the event onsale or before season ticket holder seats are 
        assigned. 
        • We do not allow meet-and-greets for third party events. 
        • Sellers are expected to be available during non-business hours to address any last-minute fulfillment issues`

        content: `It is vitally important that your seller notes are accurate and up to date. Seller notes will determine ticket 
        delivery type, making them essential for each listing.
        Your notes must include the ticket type for each listing. Accepted 3PE inventory types include: 
        • Mobile transfer
        • PDF (mobile QR code) 
        • Hard stock (UPS)
        Listings that do not specify a delivery method in the seller notes will default to UPS.
        Your notes for all mobile email transfer listings must be indicated by either: 
        • Mobile transfer
        • Mobile xfer
        • Transfer
        • XFR
        • TMX
        For PDF delivery (mobile QR code), you must have the PDF box checked – or your notes must include: 
        • PDF
        • Mobile
        • MobileQR
        • Digital
        • Eticket
        • e-tickets
        3PE Mobile Transfer
        When listing 3PE tickets, you have the option to select the Third Party Mobile Provider from the drop-down menu 
        in TradeDesk or add the provider name in your notes. 
        Following are the third party ticket providers we currently support, and the associated notes you should include 
        when listing inventory: 
        3PE Ticket Provider Acceptable Notes
        Flash Seats/AXS flash, fls, axs
        LaneOne laneone
        MLB Ballpark mlb
        One Buffalo one buffalo, onebuffalo
        Paciolan paciolan
        SeatGeek seatgeek
        Mobile transfer can be identified with generic notes (e.g., xfer, transfer); however, if we are unable to identify the 
        appropriate mobile provider, the ticket listing may not display on our marketplaces. 
        While we are in the process of developing technical solutions, we do not currently support DICE or mobile 
        ticketing that requires a phone number for fulfillment. 
        14 15
        3PE Delivery Method Definitions
        Mobile: digital transfer to the customer’s email (e.g., Flash Seats/AXS, LaneOne, MLB Ballpark, One Buffalo, 
        Paciolan, SeatGeek, etc.) 
        PDF/Electronic: printable PDF or QR screenshot that needs to be uploaded and shown on a mobile device
        UPS: hard stock ticket or printed paper PDF required for entry. The email address to fulfill the order – where you are to transfer tickets – is printed on the Purchase Order. 
        You can also find the email address in TradeDesk under “Delivery” by hovering over the mobile device icon.
        Once you complete a mobile transfer, please ensure that you mark the order as fulfilled in TradeDesk. Failure to 
        mark orders as fulfilled will delay payment and create unnecessary contact from our support teams.
        Simply access Transactions > Orders > Third Party Mobile > and select “Mark Fulfilled” for each successfully 
        transferred order. 
        You must confirm that the order has been successfully transferred to the customer before marking an order 
        fulfilled. Sellers risk a 200% penalty for failure to deliver tickets. If a customer claims they did not receive their tickets, we will request a proof of transfer from the seller. Seller 
        may also be asked to re-transfer tickets to the buyer. Proof of transfer must include the date and time the 
        tickets were transferred; event name; section, row, and seat numbers; and the email address the tickets were 
        transferred to. Seller will have three (3) business days to provide us with the proof of transfer. Failure to do so will 
        result in order cancellation; seller is subject to a penalty of up to 200%.
        Third Party Events - Venue Reconfiguration
        If there is a venue change for a third party event, orders will remain intact – regardless of whether the event is 
        General Admission or reserved seating. 
        Seller will be responsible for fulfilling orders with any updated tickets provided by the venue/Event Organizer.
        Face Value Requirement for New York Events
        To allow us to fully comply with New York Senate Bill S9461, sellers are required to provide the face value for 
        tickets to events taking place in the state of New York in order for the listings to appear on the Ticketmaster 
        marketplace. The law applies to all tickets for New York events. 
        For events where Ticketmaster is the primary ticket provider, ticket listings should be automatically populated 
        with face values once barcodes for the listings are validated. Please make sure to double-check your listings as 
        you will remain responsible for the accuracy of your listings.
        For third party events (3PE), events for which Ticketmaster is not the primary ticketer, it is your responsibility to 
        add the face value to 3PE ticket listings in your POS and to ensure that you are sending this information to us 
        and/or your tech providers. If you do not provide face value information for your 3PE listings, the tickets will not 
        be posted for sale on Ticketmaster.com.
        TICKET ACCURACY
        1. Ticketmaster does not allow speculative ticket listings of any kind. If you do not have tickets in 
        hand or cannot provide proof of contractual rights to tickets, you cannot post those tickets on any 
        Ticketmaster platform. If a seller is found to be listing a speculative or fraudulent ticket for an event, 
        we will remove the seller’s entire inventory for that event.
        2. For In Hand and Contractual inventory, such as season tickets, the Section and Row of a seat are 
        required fields. TBA/TBD, or a range, is not acceptable.
        3. Sellers are expected to remove sold inventory immediately. 
        4. Tickets listed must represent the tickets being sold (e.g., no masking).
        5. For venues where a section number is repeated, e.g., Field Box 39 and Bleacher Section 39, the 
        seller must specify the exact section that is being sold.
        6. General Admission tickets must be noted as such by including “General Admission” in the notes.
        7. Theater seats must adhere to the event manifest (if applicable) and must include precise location 
        details, e.g., Orchestra L, Mezzanine R, Balcony C, etc. Event manifests are located in TradeDesk. 
        8. Text descriptions should accurately identify the ticket being sold and should not include additional 
        marketing copy, exclamations, poor grammar, etc. Abbreviations are discouraged.
        16 17
        9. Examples of unacceptable text descriptions include:
        a. General Admission seats that state “Gets you access to the front row”
        b. Section 401, Row A listed as “FRONT ROW SEATS!!!”
        c. Mid-Floor Section 6, Row 1, listed as “Front Row Floor”
        10. For Ticketmaster Resale software product users, you must select the Standardized Notes field in 
        order for them to display to the consumer on the retail sites.
        11. Make certain you are delivering the correct tickets – as well as the correct number of tickets – to the 
        customer. We cannot compensate sellers for tickets you sent to the customer in error that were not 
        returned to you. 
        12. Listing tickets to an event that isn’t taking place at the venue (such as offsite party passes) must be 
        listed as a separate event.
        Any tickets sold which result in a cancellation due to customer confusion because of misleading or vague 
        descriptions will be charged back to the seller, and a broken status will be assigned to the order which will 
        count against the seller’s Fill Rate. Sellers may incur any costs required to provide resolution to the consumer, 
        including absorbing the difference in cost between the original tickets and acceptable tickets procured from 
        another seller, travel costs, etc.
        Ticketmaster Resale will monitor the site and may remove inventory that does not conform to the above Ticket 
        Accuracy requirements, including any listings with descriptions that are vague, inappropriate, or misleading. 
        Repeated violations may result in additional penalties including possible suspension or removal from the 
        Marketplace. Fraudulent ticket distribution will not be tolerated. Anyone caught listing fraudulent tickets will be 
        immediately banned from the Marketplace and will be charged for any and all expenses incurred to 
        correct the situation. This may include costs for substitute tickets, travel expenses to event, goodwill 
        costs in addition to the cost of the ticket. Ticketmaster Resale has invested heavily in consumer fraud 
        prevention. All sales are screened prior to a ticket request to ensure that consumers are qualified to purchase 
        inventory listed on its sites. In the event fraud is detected while an order is still pending, Ticketmaster Resale 
        reserves the right to contact the seller and cancel the order with no penalty applied to the seller. `

        content: `In the rare event that a seller cannot fulfill the confirmed order with the original tickets, or supply 
        them via the buyer’s chosen delivery method, the seller must contact Ticketmaster Resale Seller 
        Support and provide an acceptable substitute, even if that involves purchasing tickets from another 
        seller. What constitutes an acceptable ticket will be determined by the buyer.
        If the seller cannot provide an acceptable substitute, the order will be considered “broken” and 
counted against the seller’s performance metrics. In addition, the seller may be liable for any and 
all expenses to resolve the issue, including, but not limited to, the cost to secure new tickets, travel, 
and other incidental expenses the consumer may have incurred as a result of the broken order.
Ticketmaster will cancel all purchase orders related to the canceled event within 30 days of the cancellation 
notice. A debit memo will be issued for the PO amount, and the funds will be charged to the seller. Any canceled 
POs will be due back to Ticketmaster Resale.
Unless otherwise stated, the consumer must return to Ticketmaster hard stock, third party event resale tickets – 
that were sent to them via expedited (UPS) service – within 14 days of the cancellation announcement in order 
to receive a refund. Ticketmaster Resale will then return the tickets to the seller so they can be refunded by the 
original ticket provider. Digital tickets are returned automaticall.
Rejection reasons that will affect seller performance metrics:
1. Seller’s office closed/too close to event to wait.
2. Seller listed incorrect date/time/price.
3. Original tickets are not available – no acceptable substitutes.
4. Could not fill the order in time/event passed.
5. Seller did not approve as promised.
6. Seller will not split tickets per split rules.
7. Seats are not together (not noted in ticket listing).
8. Seller rejected the order and does not have substitute tickets.
9. Seller is masking ticket location.
10. Seller changed delivery method (e.g., customer selects UPS delivery and tickets can only be 
delivered via will call/emailed).
Cancellation reasons that will affect seller performance metrics:
1. Seller listed date/time/price incorrectly.
2. Customer is not comfortable with pick-up location.
3. Customer did not receive tickets or received the wrong tickets.
4. Seller did not ship the tickets.
5. Customer could not get into event.
6. Tickets are not available and no substitutes provided.
7. Seller could not fill the order before the event passed
8. Seller’s office is closed during business hours
9. Barcode loading or AVD issues
10. Change in delivery method after order finalization`
