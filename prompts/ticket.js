        #- Hello I was just wondering what does 2/5 risk and all those fraction risk mean
Does it mean like 40% chance of losing it all if itâ€™s if itâ€™s 2/5
The risk number indicates the potential for negative market movement after the tickets go on sale, so a 0/5 is us saying, there is little to no chance of these tickets going below face value
someone please give me some basic guidance on how to use proxies for resale? just bought a batch and I'm unsure how to get going with them.
you wanna do is download BP proxy switcher chrome extension. then just copy past my list of IPs? i have 25. 
is it recommended that I use a new chrome profile for every VF registration? or is switching the proxy enough.
itâ€™s always good to sign up with different ips. 
does using a different IP just mean selecting a different proxy through bp proxy switcher? or making a new chrome profile as well?
Just by selecting different ip.
U2 tickets are transferable as long as you didnâ€™t buy GA
if you use Lysted
They can transfer tickets for you with their transferless delivery BUT they offer no guarantees that it will work
I would honestly just sell them through ticketmaster resale fan to fan
if they cancel the sale anyway, they will make you pay the fees.
may I know which resell sites I should choose ? Viagogo or Lysted?ðŸ¥¹ 
I want to sell U2 tickets?
Lysted! Viagogo is for international events
can i sign up for taylor swift tickets if im not from US and therefore dont have a US phone number?
a US or Canadian phone number is essential, as you mentioned. You can rent phone numbers online or use services like those in our partnership section.
